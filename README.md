# Daniel Huang 

Welcome to my Github! My name is Daniel Huang, and I am 21 years old. I am currently first year M.A. student studying Statistics at UC Berkeley, and I graduated from UMass Amherst with a B.S. in Statistics and minor in Computer Science. I'm passionate about using data to solve problems and gain valuable insights. I have passed Actuarial Exams P and FM, and have worked with mostly P&C insurance data through my 2 internships with Travelers Insurance. I'm eager to expand my horizons and am excited to see what types of data I can work with next!
