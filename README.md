# Daniel Huang 

Welcome to my Github! 

My name is Daniel Huang, and I am 21 years old. I am currently first year M.A. student studying Statistics at UC Berkeley, and I graduated from UMass Amherst with a B.S. in Statistics and minor in Computer Science. I'm passionate about using data to solve problems and gain valuable insights. I have passed Actuarial Exams P and FM, and have worked with mostly P&C insurance data through my 2 internships with Travelers Insurance. I'm eager to expand my horizons and am excited to see what types of data I can work with next!

# Projects
## Honors Thesis
I wrote my honors thesis supervised by Professor Panagiota Birmpa and Professor Markos Katsoulakis on Uncertainty Quantification in Conditional Random Field Models for Optical Character Recognition. My thesis uses uncertainty quantification techniques, specifically utilizing the Donsker-Varadhan Representation of the KL-Divergence as a measurement of the distance between my base model built in Python with other models. 

## Home Pricing Model
I worked to create a multilinear regression model in R to predict home prices in Oregon utilizing both quantitative and qualitative predictors. After performing preliminary data exploration to find relationships between predictors, I implemented techniques such as Stepwise AIC and BIC regression, F-tests, and outlier analysis to create the final model. My model was able to predict 60% of the variation in home prices given the data.
